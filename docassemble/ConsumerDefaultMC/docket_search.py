#
# DOCKET-NUMBER FORMATS (STANDARD)
#
#   1.  Superior Court          Example: 1577CV00982
#
#       docket_number[0:1] is the case's filing year 
#       docket_number[2:3] is the court code
#       docket_number[4:5] is the case-type code
#       docket_number[6:10] is the 5-digit sequence number
#
#   2.  District Court          Example: 1670CV000072
#
#       docket_number[0:5] is the same as in the superior-court format.
#       docket_number[6:11] is the 6-digit sequence number
#
#   3.  Boston Municipal Court Example: 1401CV001026
#
#       BMC docket-number format is the same as the district-court format.
#
#   4.  Housing Court          Example: 15H84CV000436
#
#       docket_number[0:1] is the case's filing year 
#       docket_number[2:4] is the court code
#       docket_number[5:6] is the case-type code
#       docket_number[7:12] is the 6-digit sequence number
#
#   5.  Land Court             Example: 07 TL 001026
#
#       LC docket-number format is the same as the district-court format, except
#       without a court code, and the filing year, case-type code, and the
#       6-digit sequence number are each separated by a space.
#
#       NOTE: The subsequent (SBQ) land-court case type, however, has a
#       unique format. Example: 15 SBQ 00025 09-001
#       docket_number[0:6] is the same as in other land-court case types
#       docket_number[7:11] is the 5-digit plan number
#       docket_number[13:14] is the case's filing month
#       docket_number[16:] is the sequence number (likely 3 digits)
#
#   6.  Probate and Family      Example: ES15A0064AD
#
#       docket_number[0:1] is the site or court code
#       docket_number[2:3] is the case's filing year
#       docket_number[4] is the case-group code
#       docket_number[5:8] is the 4-digit sequence number
#       docket_number[9:10] is the case-type code
#
#       I'm not entirely sure what the probate and family court case group adds,
#       as the case type already tells us all the information that the case group
#       would provide. If we can figure out the case group for each case type,
#       this could be used to verify the input docket number. For example, the
#       docket number 'ES00A0000XY' should return that data with indication of conflict,
#       because the docket number tell us that the case TYPE is 'Proxy Guardianship' 
#       ('XY') but that the case GROUP is 'Adoption' ('A') instead of 'Proxy Guardianship' ('X').
#
#
#   7.  Appeals Court           Example: 2020-P-0874
#
#       The Appeals Court hears cases either as a panel ('P') or in a single-
#       justice session ('J'). The docket-number format is four-digit filing year,
#       'P' for Panel or 'J' for single justice, then the sequence number, each
#       separated by hyphens.
#
#   8.  Supreme Judicial Court  Example: SJC-13103
#
#       The Supreme Judicial Court docket number is its abbreviation ('SJC') and
#       the sequence number separated by a hyphen. No year!
#
#       NOTE: like the Appeals Court, SJC has single-justice sessions, and those
#       cases have a unique docket-number format. Example: BD-2021-034.
#       The format is case-docket type, four-digit filing year (!), then the
#       sequence number, each separated by hyphens. The case-docket types are
#       either single justice ('SJ') or bar docket ('BD').
#
# VARIATIONS
#
#   The format is not a requirement. From one case to another, or even within a
#   the same case, we will see docket numbers that do not follow the above
#   standard formats.
#
#   NOTE: I was able to find uploaded case filings only for superior-court cases,
#   so the list of variations below, except for superior-court variations, assumes
#   that other courts follow similar logic in abbreviating or varying the standard
#   docket-number format. The assumption most definitely stands for district, BMC,
#   and housing courts, as these courts share the same format as superior courts.
#
#   1.  Legend for #2 and #3 lists, below:
#
#       'YY' or 'YYYY'  : 2-digit or 4-digit year, e.g., 21 or 2021
#
#       'CC' or 'hCC'   : 2-character court code, which can be letters only (e.g.,
#                         ES for Essex Probate and Family Ct.), numbers only
#                         (e.g., 77 for Essex Cty. Super. Ct.), or two digits with
#                         prefix 'H' for housing courts. As mentioned, land-court
#                         docket numbers do not have court codes.
#
#       'TT'            : 2-letter case-type code, e.g., CV for Civil, or 2- to 4-
#                         letter case-type code for land court.
#
#       'N'             : Sequence number, e.g., 00001 for the first case in that
#                         court of that year and of that case type. The length
#                         varies between courts and leading 0s are sometimes
#                         removed entirely or all but one.
#
#       'G'             : 1-letter case-group code, applies only to Probate and
#                         Family Ct.
#
#       'S'             : Who sits, i.e., whether it is single-justice or panel
#
#   2.  Standard formats, using above abbreviations:
#
#       · YYCCTTN+          Super. Ct., Dist. Ct., BMC
#       · YYhCCN+           Housing Ct. Below, I'll just add '/ hCC'
#       · YY TT N+          Land Ct., except SBQ cases
#       · YY 'SBQ' P+ MM-N+ Land Ct., SBQ cases, P is Plan Number, MM is Month
#       · CCYYGN+TT         Probate and Family Court, G is case-group code
#       · YYYY-S-N+         Appeals Court (incl. single-justice)
#       · 'SJC'-N+          Supreme Judicial Court (excl. single-justice)
#       · 'SJ'-YYYY-N+      Supreme Judicial Court, single-justice matters
#       · 'BD'-YYYY-N+      Supreme Judicial Court, single-j. bar-docket matters
#       
#   3.  Variations other than standard format:
#
#       · YYCC-N+ / hCC     Super. Ct., Dist. Ct., BMC / Housing Ct.
#       · YYYY-N+           All trial courts
#       · YY N+             All trial courts
#       · YY-N+             All trial courts
#       · YYYY-N+           All trial courts
#       · YYCC-TT-N+ / hCC  Super. Ct., Dist. Ct., BMC / Housing Ct.
#       · YY-TT-N+          All trial courts
#       · YYTTN+[*]         All trial courts
#       · TTYY-N+[*]        All trial courts
#       · TTYYCC-N+[*]      Super. Ct., Dist. Ct., BMC / Housing Ct.
#       · CCYY-(G)N+[*]     Probate Family Ct. with or without case-group code
#       · CCTTYY-(G)N+[*]   Probate Family Ct. with or without case-group code
#
#           [*] I have not seen these variations at least in the superior-court
#               case filings I've looked at. They are included because they
#               follow the 'logic' behind the other observed variations; in fact,
#               the first two hypothetical variations, I have seen in federal
#               courts.
#
#       Note: I have not seen any variations of appellate docket numbers. 
#
#   4.  EXAMPLE, variations in practice:
#
#       In SpineFrontier, Inc. v. Cummings Props. LLC, No. 1577CV00982 (Essex Cty.
#       Super. Ct.), in that single case, we see six docket-number variations
#       being used, so we should not assume that the pro se users will (only)
#       have the docket number in the standard format:
#
#           (1) 1577-CV-00982   in the defendant's motion
#           (2) 15-0982         in the defendant's amended counterclaim
#           (3) 15-CV-00982     in the plaintiff's notice of cross-appeal
#           (4) 2015-982        in the court's final-judgment order
#           (5) 2015-00982      in the court's ruling on MSJ
#           (6) 1577CV00982     in the appellate court's notice
#
# LOCAL NOTES
#
#   Local notes are sometimes added to the docket number. For example, in superior
#   courts, civil cases on specific case-management schedules will have the
#   relevant track designations suffixed to the docket number. The three
#   designations are Average Track ('A'), Fast Track ('F'),and Accelerated Track
#   ('X'). There are other local notes, e.g., Business Litigation Session ('BLS').
#   Some courts may include the presiding judge's initials as local notes.
#
#   Only the case-management track designations appear to provide information
#   useful for pro se litigants. The other notes aid clerks of the court.
#
# OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
#
#   Because of the nature and age of the courts' physical stamps, court-stamped
#   documents are unlikely to have standardized docket numbers. This is
#   most relevant at the initial stage of a case, where pro se litigants only
#   have court-stamped civil-action cover sheet returned from the court after
#   filing a case or received from the plaintiff along with the complaint.
#   For example, in Costello v. Needham Bank, the court-stamped civil-action
#   cover sheet has "20 0735" stamped as the docket number. 
#
# ONLINE CASE ACCESS
#
#   Case information and sometimes uploaded PDFs of case filings can be found at
#   masscourts.org.
#
#   Notably (and oddly), the search engine will return with "No Matches Found"
#   if the docket number is not strictly entered in the standardized format,
#   including all the leading 0s.
#
# NOTES ON BELOW CASE-TYPE CODE DICTIONARIES
#
#   The 'AD' case-type code in BMC and district courts refers to 'Appeal' but
#   'Adoption' in probate and family courts. Because of dict key restrictions,
#   the case-type codes for Probate and Family Courts are in a separate dictionary.
#   Land Court case-type codes are also in their own dictionary for checking if
#   the docket number is erroneously missing a court code or if the court code
#   is missing because it is a case in Land Court.
