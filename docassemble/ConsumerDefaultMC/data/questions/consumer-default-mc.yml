question: |
  Motion to Vacate Default Judgment
subquestion: |
  If you do not show up for your trial when you were supposed to, you lose your case by default, and:  
  
  * The creditor wins the case by default because you did not appear at court.
  * The judge decides you owe the creditor the money the creditor claims you owe them. 
  
  Use a **Motion to Vacate Default Judgment** if:
  
  * You missed the trial because you did not know about it (Lack of Notice), **or**
  * You missed it due to the COVD-19 pandemic, **and**
  * You need another chance to {answer} the creditor's complaint. When you answer the complaint you can explain why you should not have to pay them the money they say you owe.
    
    You can only file this motion if you have your docket number.
    
    **Do you have a docket number?**

    Your Answer
    An Answer is your written statement that tells your side of the story. Your Answer explains:

    * things the plaintiff did that hurt you/were wrong.
    These explanations in your answer are called "defenses and counterclaims." You might include in your Answer:
    * Why you do not owe the money the plaintiff claims,
    * Why you do not owe as much money as the plaintiff claims, 
    * The laws the plaintiff broke.
