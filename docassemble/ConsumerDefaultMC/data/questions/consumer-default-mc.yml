  Motion to Vacate Default Judgment
subquestion: |
  If you do not show up for your trial when you were supposed to, you lose your case by default, and:  
  
  * The creditor wins the case by default because you did not appear at court.
  * The judge decides you owe the creditor the money the creditor claims you owe them. 
  
  Use a **Motion to Vacate Default Judgment** if:
  
  * You missed the trial because you did not know about it (Lack of Notice), OR
  * You missed it due to the COVD-19 pandemic, AND
  * You need another chance to {answer} the creditor's complaint. When you answer the complaint you can explain why you should not have to pay them the money they say you owe.
    
    *You can only file this motion if you have your docket number.*
    
    **Do you have the Judgment by Default paperwork from the court?**
    
yesno: intro_yesno

  answer: |
    Your Answer
    An Answer is your written statement that tells your side of the story. Your Answer explains:
    * what is wrong in the complaint and why, and
    * things the plaintiff did that hurt you/were wrong.
    These explanations in your answer are called "defenses and counterclaims." You might include in your Answer:
    * Why you do not owe the money the plaintiff claims,
    * Why you do not owe as much money as the plaintiff claims, 
    * The laws the plaintiff broke.
